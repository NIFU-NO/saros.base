  main_directory,
  files_to_process,
  mesos_df,
  main_files = c("index", "report"),

}
\arguments{
\item{main_directory}{String, path to where the _metadata.yml, stub QMD-files and their subfolders are created.}

\item{files_to_process}{Character vector of files used as templates for the mesos stubs.}

\item{mesos_df}{List of single-column data frames where each variable is a mesos variable, optionally with a variable label indicating its pretty name. The values in each variable are the mesos groups. NA is silently ignored.}

\item{main_files}{Character vector of files for which titles should be set as the mesos_group. Optional but recommended.}

\item{read_syntax_pattern, read_syntax_replacement}{Optional strings, any regex pattern to search and replace in the qmd-files. If NULL, will ignore it.}

\item{qmd_regex}{String. Experimental feature for allowing Rmarkdown, not yet tested.}

\item{subtitle_separator}{String or NULL. If a string will add title and subtitle fields to the _metadata.yml-files in the deepest child folders. The title is the mesos_group. The subtitle is a concatenation of the folder name of the main_directory and the mesos_var label.}
