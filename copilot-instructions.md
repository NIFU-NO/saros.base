# Copilot Instructions for saros.base

## Testing Workflow

Immediately alert the user if there exist no tests for the given
functions they are working on.

### Quick Testing (Preferred)

Use this for faster iteration during development:

``` r
devtools::load_all(); devtools::test()
```

- **Faster** than full check
- Runs all tests
- Good for verifying code changes quickly

### Full Package Check

Only use when necessary (e.g., before PR):

``` r
devtools::check()
```

- **Comprehensive** but slower
- Includes documentation checks, examples, etc.
- No need to run `load_all()` and `test()` separately when using this

**Important:** Never run both `devtools::check()` AND
`devtools::load_all(); devtools::test()` together - `check()` already
includes testing.

## Git Workflow Commands

### “git” command

When user says “git”: 1. Check git status 2. If on main branch with
changes, create a new branch first 3. Create commits grouped by logical
features/bug fixes 4. Tests and documentation should be grouped with the
code they relate to

### “PR” command

When user says “PR”: 1. Push the current branch to GitHub 2. Create a
Pull Request

### “PR merged” command

When user says “PR merged”: 1. User has already merged PR manually on
GitHub 2. Switch to main branch 3. Pull latest changes 4. Delete local
branch 5. Delete remote branch 6. Clean up

## File Patterns to Ignore

- `copilot-analysis-*.md` - Analysis files generated by Copilot
- `air.toml` - Build tool configuration
