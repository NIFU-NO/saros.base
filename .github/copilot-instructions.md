# Copilot Instructions for saros.base

## Testing Workflow

### Quick Testing (Preferred)
Use this for faster iteration during development:
```r
devtools::load_all(); devtools::test()
```
- **Faster** than full check
- Runs all tests
- Good for verifying code changes quickly

### Full Package Check
Only use when necessary (e.g., before PR):
```r
devtools::check()
```
- **Comprehensive** but slower
- Includes documentation checks, examples, etc.
- No need to run `load_all()` and `test()` separately when using this

**Important:** Never run both `devtools::check()` AND `devtools::load_all(); devtools::test()` together - `check()` already includes testing.

## Git Workflow Commands

### "git" command
When user says "git":
1. Check git status
2. If on main branch with changes, create a new branch first
3. Create commits grouped by logical features/bug fixes
4. Tests and documentation should be grouped with the code they relate to

### "PR" command
When user says "PR":
1. Push the current branch to GitHub
2. Create a Pull Request

### "PR merged" command
When user says "PR merged":
1. User has already merged PR manually on GitHub
2. Switch to main branch
3. Pull latest changes
4. Delete local branch
5. Delete remote branch
6. Clean up

## File Patterns to Ignore

- `copilot-analysis-*.md` - Analysis files generated by Copilot
- `air.toml` - Build tool configuration
